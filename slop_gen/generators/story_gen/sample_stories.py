Depression is quiet.

Depression isn't words, it's the words we don't say.

It's telling everyone we're fine after another night of tossing and turning.

It's in the fake smile we give our mothers because truly, we can't be the ones to break her heart.

It's the questionable look from a friend.

The small push from your dog against your leg, wondering why you've been so distant.

It's in the grayish colors of my walls. The red used to burn so bright but like any other flame, they've dimmed.

It's in the lonely eyes of my sister. In the raging glare do my brother; because for some reason, he can't do anything but fight anymore.

It's the lump in our chests we can't get rid of. It's sticks to us, and weighs like wet cement. With every step we feel it shift from side to side in our hearts, swinging us off balance.

It's in the soft, broken eyes of my boyfriend. Who's smile is beginning to wear.

Depression is in the world around me. It's in the endless fighting, the killing, the shooting, the looting, the burning.

It's in every day that burns like a thousand suns. It's in the thick frosts of winter.

It's in my best friend, and the bruises her father gave to her like roses from a garden.

It's in my Father, and the bottles that collect by his bed side. It's in every cigarette, in every dismissive shake of his head.

It's in me. Inside my thoughts, in every crevice of my broken and shattered heart. It's in my words, tangling around my numb tongue crying to escape.

It's in my bed, chaining me to the spring-ridden mattress.

It's in my bathroom, in the looming reflection of my mirror.

Depression is quiet, until it's not.

Depression is simple, until it's not.

Depression is in anything and everything. . . Until it's not.

# Conan and the Gnome Smiths

The Cimmerian's massive frame moved silently through the dense forest, a feat remarkable for a man of his size. Three days had passed since Conan had left the burning ruins of Vanir raiders' camp behind him, and the wound in his side—though bound with herbs—still ached with each breath. His once-fine broadsword had been shattered in that battle, leaving him with only a dagger and his wits.

The trees began to thin, and Conan paused as something unusual reached his ears—a rhythmic clanging, like that of many small hammers striking metal in curious harmony. The barbarian crouched lower, his blue eyes narrowing as he advanced toward the sound.

What he discovered in the small valley before him defied belief. Nestled between ancient oaks stood dozens of structures no taller than his knee—perfect miniature forges and workshops with smoking chimneys barely reaching his waist. Moving between them were small, bearded figures with skin the color of rich earth and caps of bright red and blue.

"Gnomes," Conan muttered, recalling fireside tales told by travelers from the western lands. 

He had dismissed such stories as the ramblings of men too deep in their cups, yet here was evidence that even the strangest tales might hold truth. The gnomes worked with remarkable speed and precision, their tiny hands crafting metal with skill that would shame the finest smiths of Aquilonia.

As Conan studied them from the cover of a fallen log, his trained eye recognized what they were forging—weapons, hundreds of them, though sized for human hands rather than their own. His hand instinctively moved to the empty scabbard at his side.

The decision was swift, as were all Conan's choices—to approach rather than skulk like a thief. He rose to his full height and stepped into the clearing.

The effect was immediate. A high-pitched alarm sounded, and the gnomes scattered like startled quail, disappearing into their dwellings or beneath trapdoors that Conan's eyes hadn't detected. Within moments, the village appeared deserted—save for one figure who remained standing in the village center.

This gnome was older than the others, his beard white as Cimmerian snow, his eyes glittering with intelligence and something else—amusement, perhaps. He wore an elaborate cap adorned with metallic symbols Conan couldn't decipher.

"Well met, giant," the gnome called up to him, his voice surprisingly deep for one so small. "Few find our village, and fewer still have the courage to walk openly into it."

Conan grunted, kneeling to bring himself closer to the gnome's level. "I mean no harm to your people, little one. I seek a blade to replace that which was broken."

The ancient gnome stroked his beard thoughtfully. "The Cimmerian with eyes like winter sky. We have heard of you, Conan of the North." He gestured toward Conan's bandaged side. "And you require more than steel, it seems."

"My wounds are my concern," Conan replied sharply.

The elder gnome laughed. "Indeed. Yet you come at a fortuitous time. We forge weapons not for ourselves but for trade with the tall folk of the outer world—though few know how to find us. Our greatest work in a generation was completed with yesterday's moon."

He clapped his hands three times, and a dozen gnomes emerged, carrying between them a sword upon a cushion of crimson silk. The blade gleamed with a bluish sheen that spoke of magic as much as metallurgy.

"This blade was forged for a king," the elder explained. "But perhaps it would serve a free man better."

Conan's eyes narrowed with suspicion. "And what price would you ask for such a weapon, gnome? I have little gold, and I do not barter my service easily."

"The price is already paid," the elder replied cryptically. "Three nights past, your battle with the Vanir raiders prevented them from discovering our village. Their torches would have set these woods ablaze, and our home with them." He gestured to the sword. "Take it. A fair exchange—a life for a life."

Conan hesitated only a moment before wrapping his hand around the hilt. The balance was perfect, as if crafted specifically for his grip. He raised it, watching how the light danced along its edge.

"It has no name," the elder added. "That privilege belongs to its bearer."

"Then I shall name it after its makers," Conan decided, rising to his full height with the blade. "Gnomebringer it shall be, until it earns a name in battle."

The elder gnome smiled. "A good name. Now, giant, about that wound—"

Before Conan could protest, two gnomes approached with a small pot of salve, its scent sharp and medicinal. The barbarian knew wisdom when he saw it, and knelt again to accept their healing craft.

By sunset, Conan departed the gnome village with a mended side, a full belly, and a blade that hummed with promise at his hip. The gnome elder had revealed the secret paths that would lead him safely through the forest and offered him an open invitation to return—though Conan suspected finding the village a second time would prove as difficult as the first.

As he walked the forest path, Conan reflected that the world held wonders as dangerous as its terrors, and sometimes, the smallest allies proved the most valuable. Gnomebringer gleamed at his side as the first stars appeared above, and the Cimmerian smiled—a rare expression on that hard face—as he continued his journey through the gathering night.

The whispers began three nights after moving into the old Victorian, always at precisely 3:17 AM—soft at first, like someone standing just behind me, muttering words I couldn't quite make out. Each night they grew clearer, until I could finally understand the voice was reciting names, dates, and methods of death—seventeen in total. I dismissed it as the settling of an ancient house or my imagination working overtime, until I discovered the hidden basement room with its collection of antique surgical tools and the crumbling journal detailing each "procedure." Last night, the whispers changed; now they speak only one name—mine—and tonight, as I lie awake watching the bedside clock tick toward 3:17, I notice for the first time that the whispers aren't coming from behind me at all, but seem to be emerging from my own throat."""

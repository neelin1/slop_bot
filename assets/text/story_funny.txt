1. Why did the chicken cross the road?
2. Because it saw a job interview on the other sideâ€¦ with free snacks.
3. But when it got there, the snacks were just photos of snacks.
4. The chicken never trusted recruiters again.
5. It went home. Started a YouTube channel. Became famous.
6. Now the road crosses for *it*.
